# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

## Introduction

Welcome to **alx-project-0x02-setup**, a foundational project designed to introduce and guide learners through the process of setting up a modern web application using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

This repository serves as the initial setup and structural foundation for a more comprehensive project that demonstrates:

- Creating and organizing reusable React components
- Implementing routing using the Pages Router
- Fetching data from external APIs
- Building interactive and responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Following TypeScript and project structure best practices

The goal is to gain hands-on experience with building scalable, maintainable, and well-documented web applications using industry-standard tools and practices.
